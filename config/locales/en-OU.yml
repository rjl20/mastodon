    recovery_codes: Backup recovery codes

    welcome:
      edit_profile_action: Setup profile
      edit_profile_step: You can customize your profile by uploading an avatar, header, changing your display name and more. If you’d like to review new followers before they’re allowed to follow you, you can lock your account.
      explanation: Here are some tips to get you started
      final_action: Start posting
      final_step: 'Start posting! Even without followers your public messages may be seen by others, for example on the local timeline and in hashtags. You may want to introduce yourself on the #introductions hashtag.'
      full_handle: Your full alias
      full_handle_hint: This is what you would tell your friends so they can message or follow you from another instance.

      subject: Welcome to Mastodon
      tip_bridge_html: If you are coming from Twitter, you can find your friends on Mastodon by using the <a href="%{bridge_url}">bridge app</a>. It only works if they also used the bridge app though!
      tip_federated_timeline: The federated timeline is a firehose view of the Mastodon network. But it only includes people your neighbours are subscribed to, so it's not complete.
      tip_following: You follow your server's admin(s) by default. To find more interesting people, check the local and federated timelines.
      tip_local_timeline: The local timeline is a firehose view of people on %{instance}. These are your immediate neighbours!
      tip_mobile_webapp: If your mobile browser offers you to add Mastodon to your homescreen, you can receive push notifications. It acts like a native app in many ways!
